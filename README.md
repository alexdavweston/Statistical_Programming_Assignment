# Statistical_Programming_Assignment

Hello, thank you for grading my assignment.

The R, code that I used can be found as the GSPH3_ECON0128.R file in the folder

In order to properly load up the data please take these steps.

For the travel time data, please insert the pathname for the Travel_Time_to_Work.csv file in the mobility_data <- read.csv("pathname") function in line 14

To load the NYC tracts, please load the pathname for the entire Geodata folder into the nyc_tracts <- st_read("pathname") function in line 18

Finally, for the income data, please load the pathname for the Income_data.csv file in the read.csv("pathname", sep = ";") function in line 48, please make sure that the separator function is present.

Once again, thank you very much.

Kind regards.
